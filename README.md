# AngularJS jQueryUI Autocomplete Directive

## Why not use an existing directive?

I wanted a simple, declarative and expressive directive that:

*   Doesn't need a method on view model to retrieve the suggestions, just specify a url
*   Works with simple arrays
*   Allows custom entries on simple arrays
*   Works with object arrays and allows the displayed suggestions to be configured using expressions
*   For object arrays, lets you store either the full object or a single property
*   Enables additional work to be carried out once a selection has been made
